 --- Temporary information, 30 June 2017 --- 

Until new scripts for Icepack are ready, use the old method to build and run:

Copy your Macros file from the CICE repository into the icepack/bld directory.
Edit comp_ice for your machine, paths, source and executable directories.
Edit the namelist file icepack_in as needed.
./comp_ice to build the code.
cd to your executable directory.
./icepack to run the code.

The code is currently set to run using default forcing (winter, spring and summer
options are available in icepack/configuration/driver/icepack_drv_flux.F90). 
Better forcing options will be implemented and tested.

Restart functionality has not been implemented and what is here is a mess.

Netcdf is not available.

Naming convention:

Driver modules are Icepack_drv_*.F90 or icepack_drv_*.F90, located in 
icepack/configuration/driver/.  These modules can provide guidance for implementing 
Icepack in a host sea ice model and are loosely based on modules and/or 
functionality in the cicecore/ directory of CICE.

The column physics modules are icepack_*.F90, located in icepack/columnphysics/.
